<h1>Dreamhost Broke My Website</h1>
<p>I have been using a shared Dreamhost server for my Django website 'lorenhoward.com'.  On the evening of 10/5/14 I noticed that the website was showing a 500 error because Dreamhost updated or changed something.  After some fiddling around, I am unable to get it to work with their set up.  It sort of feels like trying to fix a problem which is shrouded in a black box, and I can only shake the box to try and determine if the thing is fixed yet.<br/>
<h2>So, I'm just going to host it myself</h2>
<p>I need to know what is or isn't working, so I'll just set up a simple nginx + wsgi Django setup (no more Passenger CGI / Apache abomination).  This means this website will be down until I migrate the db and get it set up, which will hopefully be before 10/12/14.</p>
